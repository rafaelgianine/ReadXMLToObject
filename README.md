# ReadXMLToObject
<h3>Reading XML text to an Object with C#</h1>
<p>An example of an approach I did on how to read a XML text to fulfill a new instanced class.</p>
<p>This uses a combination of reflection and a external library that allow us to give aliases to our properties.</p>
<p>I needed to create this code once I found myself having 5 differents XML's files that would give the information needed to fulfill one chained object</p>
<p>The library for the aliases can be found on <u><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Management.Automation.dll/10.0.10586" class="anchor" style="color:blue">System.Management.Automation.dll</a></u>.</p>
